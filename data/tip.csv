We had a reservation and were seated on time but we had to make two trips to the hostess stand and wait twenty minutes before we a server came with water.   We waited another twenty minutes before our appetizer came.   We ordered an eggplant spread that could've been brought put much sooner which would have been a nice effort towards service recovery. \n\nLife is too short to waste it at Momos.

It is also a diverse population with almost no crime..people are friendly and not pretentious. Also pet friendly. Downside is jacking up rent  more than cost of living and lack of responsiveness of staff.  My 2 bedroom townhouse has gone from about $740 (I pay ALL utilities) 6 years ago to almost $1000 this  fall. It is owned by a large SEEMINGLY non-caring conglomerate.

Therefore I was denied because I'm American. They also do not accept duplicate licenses. I had many other forms of identification to prove it was really me ex pay stubs in my wallet insurance card credit cards debit card and college Id with photo and was still denied. I hope this place shuts down. house of brews down the road is much better

Then it is topped, buttered, flavored, etc.  it looks like one huge potato due to the skin.  But it is actually two.  Try it at home, and douse it with shredded roast beef, cheese, and sour creme...it works!!!"

Smaller pizzas to make a great personal pizza and an amazing variety of salads and soups.  Odd that you go through a cafeteria type line but you watch your salad get chopped right before your eyes.  That is very cool to watch.

The bus driver could not get a hold of the owner and didn't know what to do. Then she just left the bus and went home. The owner tells us the next day to go back to the bus and just open the back door to get our stuff out. Unbelievable. I won't be using them again. They did refund the money but you have to tip ahead of time and the bus driver would not give the tip back

My boyfriend said he would of rather the onions be small slice instead of long cuts but that was just a preference. We also ordered the pork fried rice and egg rolls. Egg rolls were delicious and the rice was fresh and held up the next day which is rare. \n\nSo glad I found this place. Have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant since moving here 6 months ago.

They were busy, we got seated fairly quick, but it was down hill from there. It seemed like 10 minutes to get our drink order, then another 19 to get any chips and salsa. They took our order and it was 29 minutes getting out, we were promised more chips, but they never came. The last one was even slower. We spend almost an hour and half in there just to eat. Will not go back.  I recommend Margarita Grill."
